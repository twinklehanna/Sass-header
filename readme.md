**This project is my first attempt to create a sass project** 

- it is just the header part of a website
- it is responsive  
- it includes:
    * variables to store colors 
    * mixins for media queries
    * sass hierarchies
    * '%' for common codes

- its a basic usage of sass and I hope it would help you to understand it better
- it you had a question feel free to ask me
